    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <h4>For the chicken:</h4>
        <li>2 1/2 cups buttermilk</li>
        <li>2 tablespoon piri piri spice blend</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon onion powder</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>3 1/2 pounds bone-in skin-on chicken legs, thighs, and wings</li>
        <h4>For the flour coating:</h4>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons piri piri spice blend</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons black pepper</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons smoked paprika</li>
        <li>1/2 tablespoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon onion powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <h4>For frying chicken:</h4>
        <li>Peanut oil or canola oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, combine the buttermilk, salt, piri piri spice blend, onion powder, and garlic powder. Add the chicken to this buttermilk mixture. Cover with plastic wrap and marinate the chicken in the refrigerator for 8 to 24 hours.</li>
        <li>In a large plastic bag or in a large bowl combine the flour, piri piri spice blend, black pepper, paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, and salt. </li>
        <li>Remove the chicken from the buttermilk marinade and allow the excess buttermilk to drip off. Individually dredge each piece into the flour mixture making sure the chicken is fully coated. Shake off the excess flour, place the chicken pieces on a sheet pan.</li>
        <li>Let the floured chicken pieces sit at room temperature for 30 minutes to help the flour adhere to the chicken and let the chicken come to room temperature. </li>
        <li> While the chicken sits for 30 minutes, fill the Dutch oven half way full with oil. Heat the oil, over medium-high heat until the oil reaches 325°F when using a kitchen thermometer.

            Alternatively, to tell if your oil is ready for frying you can add a pinch of flour into the oil, and when it begins to sizzle, your oil is ready. </li>
        <li>Cook the chicken in batches by adding a few pieces of chicken to the pot and fry for about 15 minutes, turning halfway through the cooking time. Your chicken is full cooked through when the thickest part of the chicken pieces reaches 165°F when inserted with a digital thermometer. </li>
        <li>When the chicken is golden brown and cooked through, remove the chicken using tongs and place on a rack over a baking sheet to drain any excess oil.</li>
        <li>Serve fried chicken warm along with your favorite sides </li>
    </ol>
