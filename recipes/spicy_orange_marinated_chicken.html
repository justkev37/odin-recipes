    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Chicken thighs, pounded thin, marinated in mixture of orange juice, onion, garlic, herbs, and chipotle, then quickly pan fried. Delicious!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups freshly squeezed orange juice from 3 to 4 large
             navel oranges, or 6 small oranges, peeled and chopped</li>
        <li>1 onion, chopped (about 1 1/2 cups)</li>
        <li>1/2 of a (7-ounce) can of chipotle chili peppers in adobo (3 1/2 ounces total)</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, chopped</li>
        <li>1/3 cup chopped fresh cilantro</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon fresh rosemary leaves, chopped, or 1 teaspoon dried</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon fresh thyme leaves, or 1 teaspoon dried</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon fresh marjoram or oregano leaves, or 1 teaspoon dried of either</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>3 pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs (4 pounds if buying bone-in)</li>
        <li>Chopped fresh cilantro or parsley and orange slices, for garnish</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a blender or food processor, combine the orange juice or chopped oranges, onion, chipotle in adobo, garlic, cilantro, rosemary, thyme, marjoram, and salt.</li>
        <li>With scissors, snip off the excess fat from the thighs.</li>
        <li>Put the chicken thighs between two sheets of plastic wrap or wax paper and pound with a meat mallet or rolling pin until an even thickness of about 1/2-inch. </li>
        <li>Add the chicken to the bowl of marinade (or transfer both to a zipper freezer bag). Refrigerate 2 hours or overnight.</li>
        <li> Heat the olive oil in a large cast iron pan or heavy skillet on medium high heat.

            Remove the chicken pieces from the marinade, blotting off the excess (but not all) with a paper towel.
            
            Working in batches, cook the chicken pieces for 5 minutes on each side, or until browned and cooked through. </li>
        <li>Sprinkle the chicken with chopped cilantro or parsley, garnish with orange wedges and serve with Spanish rice. </li>
    </ol>
